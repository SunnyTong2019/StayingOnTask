## Project title

Staying on Task: a roadmap to completing your projects

## Motivation

Every year, countless hours are spent on figuring out and writing down the tasks needed to complete a project, where, instead, this time could be used to executing and completing them.

StayingOnTask helps users cut down the time needed to create tasks and manage their projects.

Our first themes are birthday parties and weddings that come with prepopulated tasks for each event

## Tech/framework used

This app uses MySQL, Node.js, HTML, Javascript, Express, Passport, Handlebars and Sequelizer, EsLint, TravisCI, Materialize, Moment and DotEnv.
